# Asado

## Ingretients
- Chorizos: small pork sausages.
- Morcilla: blood sausages.
- Tira de asado: the perennial favorite, short ribs.
- Vacio: flank steak.
- Bife ancho: rib-eye steak.
- Lomo: tenderloin.
- Mollejas: sweetbreads, delicious when cooked until crispy on a hot fire with plenty of lemon.

## Directions
Now you're all set and the asador will be nominated. Once designated, for better or worse, he or she takes charge of the process from start to finish - and no interference is tolerated. A real asador will have a razor sharp, thick bladed guacho knife that slips into the belt.

Get the coals ready.

Spread the coals out under the grill in a rectangular shape (nothing in the middle), creating a gentle, even heat from all sides. Always be sure to keep a fire going on the side to ensure that you have enough coals for at least an hour. Slow cooking is key; the temperature is right when you hear a gentle but constant sizzling.

Time to cook.

Add the beef, chorizos, morcilla, and cheese to the grill at the same time to break the asado up into various courses.

First off the grill will be the provoleta, cut into delicious molten squares to be passed. Next up, the morcilla, as it only needs to be warmed through before serving. Then the chorizos, served with mini-baguettes and a good chimichurri to make the classic choripan. (Of course the chef remembered to toast the bread lightly on the grill for a minute before serving the sausages.)

Finally the meat, the climax of the event.
